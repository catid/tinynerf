The goal of this repository is to maintain a concise, efficient and practical implementation of [NeRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934). Currently it implements the factorized planes method from [K-Planes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10241), accelerated using OpenAI [Triton](https://github.com/openai/triton) kernels.
