# tinynerf

Concise (<1000 locs) and fast implementation of several NeRF techniques. Currently it contains an implementation of vanilla [NeRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934), [K-Planes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10241) and [Cobafa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01226), accelerated with a single CUDA kernel to compute the weights from 'NeRF equation'.
